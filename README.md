#  Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant financial and demographic details. A Decision Tree Classifier is trained and deployed using Streamlit to provide real-time predictions through a web interface.

##  Machine Learning Approach
- Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
- Evaluation: Accuracy and classification report
- Deployment: Streamlit dashboard

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- GitHub Codespaces

##  How to Run the Project
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
